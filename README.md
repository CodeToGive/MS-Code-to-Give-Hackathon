<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The beneficiaries of St. Judes India ChildCare Centres can request for aid in various financial as well as non-financial aspects like Education,Health,Career Counselling,Life Skills etc in the future through the website of St. Judes For Life. Those who have received aid for cancer treatment by the SJICC can login and request aid. The Program Coordinators(Admins) can ask for and verify the documents submitted by beneficiaries and accept or reject their request accordingly. They can give aid and keep track of all the transactions for aid. The users can also opt to have a meeting with a volunteer through the website or request an offline meet. The site also provides means of accepting donations from donators. This website breaks the barriers between different parts of the world. It offers an easy online way of giving aid to beneficiaries. It also breaks language barriers by offering 5 different languages for the user.
